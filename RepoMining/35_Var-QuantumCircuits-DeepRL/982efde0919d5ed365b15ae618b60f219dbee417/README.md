# Variational-Quantum-Circuits-DeepReinforcementLearning


**NEWS** We start a non-commericial interview series: a first talk with Sam and his experience working VQC-DRL since 2018. 

Feel free to check the videos, if you are interested in the stories behind. [Part 1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpnw8x3ob5E) and [Part 2 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIWxpA_X1w&). 

This is the numerical code for the article: \
[Variational Quantum Circuits for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00397) (first released in Aug. 2019)


- This work awarded the Xanadu AI software competition 2019 research track first prize. [News](https://medium.com/xanaduai/xanadu-software-competition-the-results-are-in-9ccb6a3b591b?source=collection_home---6------5-----------------------)

We also sincerely thank the supports from Xanadu AI to provide PennyLane, which is a great value to the quantum AI community.
