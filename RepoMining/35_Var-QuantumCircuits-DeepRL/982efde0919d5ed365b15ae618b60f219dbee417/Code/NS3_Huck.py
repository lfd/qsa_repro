			ob (object) :
				an environment-specific object representing your observation of

			reward (float) :
				amount of reward achieved by the previous action. The scale
				varies between environments, but the goal is always to increase
				your total reward.
			episode_over (bool) :
				whether it's time to reset the environment again. Most (but not
				all) tasks are divided up into well-defined episodes, and done
				being True indicates the episode has terminated. (For example,
				perhaps the pole tipped too far, or you lost your last life.)
			info (dict) :
				 diagnostic information useful for debugging. It can sometimes
				 be useful for learning (for example, it might contain the raw
				 probabilities behind the environment's last state change).
				 However, official evaluations of your agent are not allowed to
				 use this for learning.
